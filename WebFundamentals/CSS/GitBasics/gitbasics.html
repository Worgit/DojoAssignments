					<h2>What is Git?</h2>
					<p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of 
					snapshots (commits) of your code base.  With the creation of each 
					snapshot you build out a application, seeing the growth of a full app.  
					During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to 
					previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into your app.</p>
					<h2>What is Github?</h2>
					<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and 
					collaboration.  It lets you and others work together on projects from 
					anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

					<h3>Git init</h3>
					<p><span class = "blue">Git init</span> is the act of registering this 
					current code base.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "small">
					<h3>Git add</h3>
					<p><span class = "blue">Git add</span> is how we stage the interaction of 
					our current code base into our current list of snapshots.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "small">
					<h3>Git status</h3>
					<p><span class = "blue">Git status</span> allows us to see the changes 
					that we are going to make.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "medium">
					<h3>Git commit</h3>
					<p><span class = "blue">Git commit</span>; finally we can commit those 
					changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our 
					code with whatever new changes we made.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "medium">
					<h3>Git remote add</h3>
					<p><span class = "blue">Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online 
					repository where we can place all of our current code.  This is where the 
					outside world can see our code base.</p>
				</div>
				<div id = "large">
					<h3>Git push</h3>
					<p><span class = "blue">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, 
					an excellent place to store all of our repositories.  Other developers 
					might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, 
					pull down our code, and add new features or even update our code base 
					with features that they wanted to add.</p>
