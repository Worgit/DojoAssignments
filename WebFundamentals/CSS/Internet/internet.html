				<h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
				<p>Computers connected to the <span class = "blue">Web</span> are called 
				clients and servers.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class = "blue">Clients</span> are the typical Web user's 
					Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your 
					Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and 
					<span class = "blue">Web-accessing software</span> available on those 
					devices (usually a browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
					<li><span class = "blue">Servers</span> are computers that store 
					<span class = "blue">webpages</span>, <span class = "blue">sites</span>, 
					or <span class = "blue">apps</span>.  When a client device wants to 
					access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server 
					onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The browser goes to the <span class = "blue">DNS Server</span> and 
					finds the address of the <span class = "blue">server</span> that the 
					website lives on.</li>
					<li>The browser sends an <span class = "blue">HTTP request</span> message 
					to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
					<li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the 
					client a <span class = "blue">"200 OK" message</span>, which means 
					"Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's 
					files to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
					<li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and 
					displays it to you!</li>
