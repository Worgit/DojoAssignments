			<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language.  
			JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and 
			lightweight language allowing for maximum flexibility for developers to take 
			it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host 
			environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects 
			of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class = "link">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables 
				are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with 
				coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds the value.  All 
				JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique 
				names are called identifiers. <span class = "code">var x;</span></li>
				<li><span class = "link">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators 
				assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee 
				poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment 
				operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class = "code">var x = 10;
				</span></li>
				<li><span class = "link">Data Types</span> Data types are an important 
				concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data 
				type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - 
				<span class = "code">true</span> or <span class = "code">false;</span> 
				null - <span class = "code">null</span> aka nothing; Number - 
				<span class = "code">42</span> or <span class = "code">3.14159;</span> 
				String = <span class = "code">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - 
				<span class = "code">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - 
				<span class = "code">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
				<li><span class = "link">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you 
				want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting 
				different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.  
				You can use different conditional statements in your code to accomplish 
				this.  There are the following conditional statements: 
				<span class = "code">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this 
				code in our code block; <span class = "code">else if</span> to specify a 
				new condition to test, if the first condition is false; 
				<span class = "code">else</span> we execute this kind of code;</li>
				<li><span class = "link">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of 
				loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same 
				thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have 
				to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
				That's a loop!</li>
				<li><span class = "code">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation 
				of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code 
				block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we 
				are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual 
				and get started, first we screw in the legs to the table top; next we 
				place the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done!  We 
				finished up our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so 
				lets call our function over and over again.</li>
